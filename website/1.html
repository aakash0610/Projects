            <ul>Australia Bush fire Analysis ( Bush Fire Whiz)
                <p>The project is aimed at delivering a website that will display active bush fire locations in Australia as well as showing on the map areas of potential bush fire.
This was a group project with 3 members involved. I, Jamin, and Ravinder. We developed a website that displays current locations in Australia with active bush fires and shows locations that are most likely prone to bush-fire.
The bush fire website project is also developed to give insights into the patterns of bush fires in Australia. It may assist researchers in establishing potential causes of the bush fires and identify which states and territories in Australia possess a higher risk of experiencing bush fire disasters.
The project is named Bush Fire Whiz depicting that wizard-like information drawn from the bush fire data collected from the NASA MODIS satellites</p>

            <ul class="h3text">Breast cancer data analysis using Clustering Algorithm
                <p>For our data mining subject (CP5634) we were handed a project to analyze a data set and report a conclusion based on the analysis. The topic we chose was Breast Cancer in Australia.
The data obtained by one of three domains provided by the Oncology Institute has repeatedly appeared in the machine learning literature. It includes 201 instances of one class and 85 instances of another class.
In this project, we chose the clustering data mining algorithm as it is used to provide an effective analysis of the breast cancer data set. Basically, the clustering algorithm has various techniques, but in our analysis, we used the below clustering algorithm such as,
                    Simple K-Means, Filtered cluster, Hierarchical Cluster, EM Cluster. </p>
